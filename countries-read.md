# Countries I've Read Books from or about

For several of these countries, I've read multiple books, but I'm only listing
a most recent or best selection to keep things simple. Any country where I've
read more than ten books I'll mark with a star (\*).

Where possible, I want the author to be from the country in question, but the
work doesn't have to be translated to qualify. When not born in the country,
ideally the book should take place in the country in question.

For inspiration on completing the list, can check out resources like [Every
Country’s Highest-Rated Book by a Local
Author](https://wordfinderx.com/blog/highest-rated-book-map/)
