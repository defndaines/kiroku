# Countries I’ve Read Books from or About

For several of these countries, I’ve read multiple books, but I’m only listing
a most recent or best selection to keep things simple. Any country where I’ve
read more than ten books I’ll mark with a star (\*).

My definitions here are a little loose. Where possible, I want the author to
be from the country in question, but the work doesn’t have to be translated to
qualify. When the author was not born in the country, ideally the book should
take place in the country in question. For non-fiction, the book needs to be
about the country, regardless of author’s origin. Some authors get a little
difficult to place, like Isabel Allende, who was born in Peru but is Chilean
(and now American) by citizenship.

For inspiration on completing the list, can check out resources like [Every
Country’s Highest-Rated Book by a Local
Author](https://wordfinderx.com/blog/highest-rated-book-map/)

The _New York Times_ has some guides to [Read Your Way Around the
World](https://www.nytimes.com/series/literary-guides).

[Read Around the World Challenge](https://readaroundtheworldchallenge.com/)
lets you track based upon birthplace of the author.
