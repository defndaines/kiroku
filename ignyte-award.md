# Ignyte Award

The Ignyte Awards consider only works, entities, and persons within the realm
of speculative literature, to include fantasy, science-fiction, horror,
magical realism, and their associated subgenres. Ignyte Awards juries are
comprised of 25 BIPOC+ individuals; a mix of avid readers, reviewers, and
winners from previous years. The jury selects the finalists, then the awards
are opened to a free, public ballot.
