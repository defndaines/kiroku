# Nommo Awards

The Nommo Awards recognize works of speculative fiction by Africans. This
means science fiction, fantasy, stories of magic and traditional belief,
alternative histories, horror, and strange stuff that might not fit in
anywhere else.

Members of the African Speculative Fiction Society (ASFS) nominate works and
vote for winners.
