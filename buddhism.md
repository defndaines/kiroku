## Notes

Theravāda (not Hinayāna): School of the elders

Mahāyāna: Great vehicle

Sangha: order of monks

Five Hindrances (nīrvaraņa)
1. Sensuous lust
1. Ill-will
1. Physical and menal torpor and languor
1. Restlessness and worry
1. Doubt

Evil is form ignorance (avijjā) and false views (micchā ditthi)

Saddhā (Sanskrit, śraddhā, sometimes translated as faith, belief, or
confidence)
Three aspects
1. Full and firm conviction that a thing is
1. Serene joy at good qualities, and
1. Aspiration or wish to achieve an object in view

Buddhism is not something to hold on to, but an instrument to use in aiding
people on their way.

Four Noble Truths (Cattāri Ariyasaccāni)
1. Dukkha
1. Samudaya: the arising of Dukkha
1. Nirodha: the cessation of Dukkha
1. Magga: the path

Dukkha
Neither pessemistic/optimistic — objective, realist.
Word connotes suffering, imperfection, *impermanence*, emptiness,
insubstatiality.

With regards to all pleasures (all things), one must consider
1. attraction or enjoyment
1. evil consequences or danger or unsatisfactoriness, and
1. freedom o liberation

Dukkha — viewed from three aspects
1. as ordinary suffering
1. as produced by change, and
1. as conditioned states.

The five aggregates (are Dukkha)
1. aggregate of matter — physical/sensual world
1. aggregate of sensations — all sensations from contact from physical world
  (happy, sad, etc.)
  note: the mind is treated like a sixth sense organ in Buddhism, it is not a
  spirit as in most religions.
  - the world of ideas/thought exists as does the physical
1. aggregate of perceptions
1. aggregate of mental formations — all volitional activities (includes Karma,
  the Buddha defined it as volition)
1. aggregate of consciousness — for example, visual consciousness is seeing,
  but doesn't include recognizing.

There is no Self, Soul, or Ego as opposed to matter.
  The fifth aggregate does not mean a self exists.
  The "I" is only a convenient name for the combination of the five
  aggregates.

The self is like a line in math. It is a series of points, but when viewed
together is called a line.

The arising of Dukkha (Samudaya)
The most immediate cause is tanhā (thirst ... desires)
- Not the singular cause, however.
- Arises from ignorant conception of self, cause to all problems.
