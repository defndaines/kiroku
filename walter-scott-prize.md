# Walter Scott Prize

The Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction is a British literary award
founded in 2010. Sir Walter Scott is generally considered the originator of
historical fiction with the novel _Waverley_ in 1814. Eligible books must have
been first published in the UK, Ireland or Commonwealth in the preceding year.
For the purpose of the award, historical fiction is defined as being that
where the main events take place more than 60 years ago, i.e., outside of any
mature personal experience of the author.

The winner is announced each June at the Borders Book Festival in Melrose.
