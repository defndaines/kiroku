Repository for Historical Documents.

This is a central place for me to store documents that are mostly useful for
personal reasons, if useful at all.

## Books

I use awards to guide some of my reading choices. To that end, I keep track of
which award-winning books I've read in the following files.

* [Booker Prize](booker-prize.md)
* [Hugo Award](hugo-award.md)
* [Locus Award](locus-award.md)
* [National Book Award](national-book-award.md)
* [Nebula Award](nebula-award.md)
* [Nobel Prize in Literature](nobel-literature.md)
* [Pulitzer Prize](pulitzer.md)
* [Women's Prize for Fiction](womens.md)
* [World Fantasy Award](world-fantasy.md)

I also try to read books from different countries, and that's tracked in
[Countries Read](countries-read.md).
