Repository for Historical Documents.

This is a central place for me to store documents that are mostly useful for
personal reasons, if useful at all. Mostly about books I’ve read or plan to
read. All the non-literary stuff has been pushed into [other](other).

## Books

I keep my
[Goodreads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6142552-michael-daines)
up to date with what I’ve read and when, but I also track by year:

* [2025](2025-reading.md)
* [2025 Graphic Novels](2025-graphic-novels.md)
* [2024](2024-reading.md)
* [2023](2023-reading.md)

I’ve also been tracking with
[StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/daines) since 2024, though
some of the statistics there (format, language) aren’t tracked correctly.

I use awards to guide some of my reading choices. To that end, I keep track of
which award-winning books I’ve read in the following files.

* [Booker Prize](booker-prize.md)
* [Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence](carnegie-medal.md)
* [Arthur C. Clarke Award](clarke-award.md)
* [International Dublin Literary Award](dublin-award.md)
* [Golden Poppy Book Award](golden-poppy.md)
* [Hugo Award](hugo-award.md)
* [Ignyte Award](ignyte.md)
* [Kirkus Prize](kirkus.md)
* [Locus Award](locus-award.md)

Not awards, but lists I’d like to read more of.

* [The Atlantic’s Great American Novels](great-american-novels.md)
* [NYT’s Best Books of 21st Century](nyt-100-best-21st-century.md)

I try to read books from different countries, and that’s tracked in
[Countries Read](countries-read.md).
