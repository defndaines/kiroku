Repository for Historical Documents.

This is a central place for me to store documents that are useful for personal
reasons, if useful at all. Mostly about books I’ve read or plan to read. All
the non-literary stuff has been pushed into [other](other).

## Books

I keep my
[Goodreads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6142552-michael-daines)
up to date with books and graphic novels I’ve read and when. I also track
books and nonfiction graphic novels at
[StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/daines), where I try to
accurately track format. I track individual comics and some graphic novels at
[League of Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/daines/collection).

And, I track it all myself here:

* [2026](2026-reading.md)
* [2026 Graphic Novels](2026-graphic-novels.md)

Older reading records (started in 2023):

* [2025](2025-reading.md) and [2025 Graphic Novels](2025-graphic-novels.md)
* [2024](2024-reading.md)
* [2023](2023-reading.md)

### Awards

track of which award-winning books I’ve read in the following files.

### TBR

I have an overly long (> 900) “To Be Read” pile that I’ve broken down by
format and sorted by ratings. I also have
[scripts](https://github.com/defndaines/dal/tree/main/gr) for maintaining
these lists and searching for new entries.

* [Audiobooks](data/audiobooks.md) if the books are available on audio, either
  through the library (Libby and Hoopla) or Audible.
* [“Eye” Books](data/eyebooks.md) if the books are available in print or
  electronically through the library, or if the books aren’t available in any
  other format. If I own a copy, it is marked with `[own]`. Otherwise, I will
  buy or request from the library when I’m ready to read them.

I have a wishlist at
[Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/wishlists/e95d485f4528665e47e9a95cf22e759f741ae69d).
I track more obscure and hard-to-find books on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2B071NDZWAZPX).
