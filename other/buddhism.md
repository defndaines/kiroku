## Notes

Theravāda (not Hinayāna): School of the elders

Mahāyāna: Great vehicle

Sangha: order of monks

### Five Hindrances (nīrvaraņa)

1. Sensuous lust
1. Ill-will
1. Physical and mental torpor and languor
1. Restlessness and worry
1. Doubt

Evil is from ignorance (avijjā) and false views (micchā ditthi)

### Saddhā (Sanskrit, śraddhā, sometimes translated as faith, belief, or
confidence)

Three aspects
1. Full and firm conviction that a thing is
1. Serene joy at good qualities, and
1. Aspiration or wish to achieve an object in view

Buddhism is not something to hold on to, but an instrument to use in aiding
people on their way.

### Four Noble Truths (Cattāri Ariyasaccāni)

1. Dukkha
1. Samudaya: the arising of Dukkha
1. Nirodha: the cessation of Dukkha
1. Magga: the path

### Dukkha

Neither pessimistic / optimistic — objective, realist.

Word connotes suffering, imperfection, *impermanence*, emptiness,
insubstantiality.

With regards to all pleasures (all things), one must consider
1. attraction or enjoyment
1. evil consequences or danger or unsatisfactoriness, and
1. freedom of liberation

Dukkha — viewed from three aspects
1. as ordinary suffering
1. as produced by change, and
1. as conditioned states.

The five aggregates (are Dukkha)
1. aggregate of matter — physical/sensual world
1. aggregate of sensations — all sensations from contact from physical world
  (happy, sad, etc.)
  Note: the mind is treated like a sixth sense organ in Buddhism, it is not a
  spirit as in most religions. The world of ideas/thought exists as does the physical
1. aggregate of perceptions
1. aggregate of mental formations — all volitional activities (includes Karma,
  the Buddha defined it as volition)
1. aggregate of consciousness — for example, visual consciousness is seeing,
  but doesn't include recognizing.

There is no Self, Soul, or Ego as opposed to matter.
  The fifth aggregate does not mean a self exists.
  The "I" is only a convenient name for the combination of the five
  aggregates.

> The self is like a line in math. It is a series of points, but when viewed
> together is called a line.

The arising of Dukkha (Samudaya)
The most immediate cause is tanhā (thirst ... desires)
- Not the singular cause, however.
- Arises from ignorant conception of self, cause to all problems.

Four Nutriments (āhāra) necessary for existence
1. ordinary material food
1. contact of our sense organs (including mind) with the eternal world
1. consciousness, and
1. mental volition or will (to exist, re-exist, continue, become more and more)

A being has within its nature the nature of arising and of cessation /
destruction.

Karma (kamma) is volitional action, not its effects as it is commonly
misconceived.
- it produces effects, good or bad
- not to be confused with "moral justice" or "reward and punishment" which are
ideas of a one-god religion
- karma is cause and effect, inertia of actions (good or bad)

Rebirth is a continuance of the series (of change)
- idea that action one moment affects action the next moment, perpetually.
(samsāra)
- can only be cut off through wisdom which sees Reality, Truth, Nirvāna

### The Cessation of Dukkha (Nirodha)

- to eliminate dukkha one has to eliminate the main root—thirst (tanhā)
- reach Nirvāna—cannot be expressed in words.
  - human language is developed to deal with sensory experience. Absolute Truth
    is beyond that—Super Mundane.
  - neither positive or negative

Nirvāna is not the natural result of cessation of dukkha—a result would imply
cause and karma

parinirvāna (parinibbuto): denotes that the Buddha or an Arahant who has
realized nirvāna has died.
- Nirvāna is not a state
- "to enter Nirvāna" doesn't make sense and doesn't appear in original texts.

### The Path: Magga

#### Middle Path

Because avoids two extremes—search for happiness through pleasures of the
senses and through self-mortification in different forms of asceticism.

#### Noble Eightfold Path
1. Right Understanding (Sammā ditthi)
1. Right Thought (Sammā sańkappa)
1. Right Speech (Sammā vācā)
1. Right Action (Sammā kammanta)
1. Right Livelihood (Sammā ājīva)
1. Right Effort (Sammā vāyāma)
1. Right Mindfulness (Sammā sati)
1. Right Concentration (Sammā samādhi)

Three essentials of Buddhist training and discipline:
1. Ethical Conduct (Sīla)
1. Mental Discipline (Samādhi)
1. Wisdom (Paññā)

### Anatta (no soul or ātman)

- concept of self is responsible for all evil in world
- self-protection (idea of god) and self-preservation (immortal soul) develop
from this.

Conditioned Genesis—nothing in _the world_ is absolute.
- every thing is conditioned and conditioning. "free will"—how? will is
conditioned ...

Conventional truth and ultimate truth
- dhamma: everything, conditioned or unconditioned, including Nirvāna (=
Truth).
- saṃkhāra: everything conditioned—dukkha

### Bhāvanā (Meditation or Mental Culture)

- it is not an escape as is commonly misconceived
- aims at cleansing the mind of impurities and disturbances and cultivating
such qualities as concentration, awareness, intelligence, will, energy, the
analytical faculty, confidence, joy, tranquility, leading finally to the
attainment of highest wisdom.

Two kinds
1. Development of mental concentration (samatha/samādhi). Of one-pointedness
   of mind (existed pre-Buddha)
1. Vipassanā—true Buddhist meditation. Analytical method based on mindfulness,
   awareness, vigilance, observation.

Basic: breathing in-and-out, sitting erect and concentrating on only your
breathing.

Also: just being mindful of everything you do during the day.

Also: "meditation" on ethical, spiritual, and intellectual subjects.

Also: "meditation" on factors of enlightenment or questions about the
aggregates.

### Buddhists

- Traditionally takes the "Triple-Gem" as one's refuge. The Buddha, the Dhamma
(teaching), and the Sangha (order of monks)
- Five precepts or minimal moral obligations
 1. Not to destroy life
 1. not to steal
 1. not to commit adultery
 1. not to tell lies, and
 1. not to take intoxicating drink

People should be well off financially, poverty breeds crime.
